This repository contains the documents Russia submitted to the UN Security Council in a special session on March 18, 2022. In his [statement], Russia's permanent representative Vassily Nebenzia alleged the documents would prove "that Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) directly funded and supervised military biological projects in Ukraine."

The documents were shared as a [Yandex folder] via an [announcement] on Twitter:

The repository here contains those original documents in the first folder. The second folder has the same structure, but document names and content were (machine-)translated from Russian to English. The third folder has the original or translated English documents in chronological order, minus the notes added by the Russian analyst.
